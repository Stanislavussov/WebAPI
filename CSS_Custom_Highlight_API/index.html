        Manchester City may be 3-1 up in their Champions League Round of 16 tie
        against FC Copenhagen but manager Pep Guardiola (53) has warned his
        defending champions against any complacency in Wednesday's second leg
        clash at home. City, second in the Premier League, face leaders
        Liverpool on Sunday who they trail by a point but the Spaniard said the
        focus remained on reaching the Champions League quarter-finals. "In
        football, details make the difference. Everything can happen," he told
        reporters on Tuesday. "We concede a goal in the 85th minute ... concede
        two, we have to go to extra time. "I have a lot of respect for
        Copenhagen. They defend, they have a good system... they're really well
        organised," he added.
